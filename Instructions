Instructions to run my program



• When you run the program in visual studio  it will prompt you to enter “full path” of the 



input.txt  which is the Input_concepts.txt that you have given . I have renamed the file as 



input.txt and I have attached it.



• After entering the input file it will ask you to enter the “full path” of  metathesaurus  file 



Which is the “rrf” file that you sent us. I’ve renamed it as “meta.rrf “



• Now it will ask you to print the name of the text file where you want your output. So simply type 



in any name eg “op.txt” and then when you check for it in your system , op.txt will be created 



and you can see the expected output in your text file.



Things I have attached



• Executable



• Input.txt -‡ you provided it. I just renamed it for simplicity.



• Meta.rrf-‡ you provided it. I renamed it for simplicity- 



• Tokenizer.h -‡my code



• Tokenizer.cpp-‡ my code



• Main.cpp-‡my code



• Op.txt-‡ output generated



For simplicity I included all the above input files in my visual studio project that I created so all had 



the same path . So my program code and all the files listed above where stored inside my visual studio 



project that I created. 



While giving paths please include  “\\” and not single slash.
